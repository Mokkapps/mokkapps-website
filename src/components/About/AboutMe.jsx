          Programming is my passion â€“ but especially developing complex business
          applications both in frontend and in backend. I totally enjoy my work
          as a freelance developer and developing{' '}
          <a href="/projects">private projects</a> under the pseudonym Mokkapps.
          The reason why I <a href="/blog">write blog posts</a>,{' '}
          <a href="/publications">do talks or write articles</a> is that I like
          to share my knowledge with others. Therefore, I also try to share most
          of my projects <a href="https://github.com/Mokkapps">via GitHub</a>.
