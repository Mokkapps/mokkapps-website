        My name is Michael Hoffmann and I'm a software developer from the
        Bavarian Forest that currently lives in Munich. Mokkaps is the pseudonym

        I really love programming â€“ but especially JavaScript because of its
        ecosystem and possibilities. Therefore I totally enjoy developing{' '}
        <a href="projects">private projects</a> besides working as a

        The reason why I <a href="blog">write blog posts</a>,{' '}
        <a href="publications">do talks or write articles</a> is that I like to
        share my knowledge with others. Therefore, I also try to share most of
        my projects <a href="https://github.com/Mokkapps">via GitHub</a>.

        If I do not invest my time in coding I'm usually playing video games or
