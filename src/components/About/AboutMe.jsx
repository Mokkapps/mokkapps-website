          My name is Michael Hoffmann, a freelance web and app developer based
          in Munich/ Germany. I hold a Masters in Electrical Engineering from
          the reknown Technical University of Munich (TUM) and have{' '}
          {new Date().getFullYear() - 2015} years of professional experience.
        </AboutParagraph>
        <AboutParagraph>
          I work for businesses of all sizes and have experience with both small
          and medium enterprises and corporates. In my career I have developed,
          maintained and launched multiple projects from scratch or improved an
          existing legacy code base. <a href="/contact">Get in touch</a>, if you
          like to receive a detailed list of projects I have worked on so far.
        </AboutParagraph>
        <AboutParagraph>
          I really love programming â€“ but especially JavaScript because of its
          ecosystem and possibilities. Therefore I totally enjoy developing{' '}
          <a href="/projects">private projects</a> under the pseudonym Mokkapps
          besides working as a freelance developer. The reason why I{' '}
          <a href="/blog">write blog posts</a>,{' '}
          <a href="/publications">do talks or write articles</a> is that I like
          to share my knowledge with others. Therefore, I also try to share most
          of my projects <a href="https://github.com/Mokkapps">via GitHub</a>.
        </AboutParagraph>
        <AboutParagraph>
          If I do not invest my time in coding I'm usually playing video games
          or doing sports.
        </AboutParagraph>
        <AboutParagraph>
          Just <a href="/contact">contact me</a> if you would like me to work
          for you.
