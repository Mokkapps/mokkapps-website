It is important to monitor an application's metrics and health which helps us to improve performance, manage the app in a better way, and notice unoptimized behavior. 
Monitoring each service is important to be able to maintain a system that consists of many microservices.

In this blog post, I will demonstrate how a Spring Boot web application can be monitored using [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) which 
exposes metrics from our application, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) which stores the metric data, and [Grafana](https://grafana.com) to visualize the data in graphs.

Implementing these tools can be done quite easily by adding just a few configurations. Additional to the default JVM metrics I will show how you can expose custom metrics like a user counter.

As always, the code for the demo used in this article can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mokkapps/custom-metrics-spring-boot-demo).

## Spring Boot

The base for our demo is a Spring Boot application which we initialize using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=de.mokkapps&artifactId=custom-metrics-demo&name=custom-metrics-demo&description=Custom%20metrics%20demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=de.mokkapps.custom-metrics-demo&dependencies=devtools,lombok,web,actuator,prometheus):

![Spring Initializr](./images/spring-initializr.png)

We initialized the project using `spring-boot-starter-actuator` which already exposes [production-ready endpoints](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-endpoints.html).

If we start our application we can see that some endpoints like `health` and `info` are already exposed to the `/actuator` endpoint per default: 

Triggering the `/actuator/health` endpoint gives us a metric if the service is up and running: 

```bash
▶ http GET "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health"
HTTP/1.1 200
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/vnd.spring-boot.actuator.v3+json
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2020 18:11:35 GMT
Keep-Alive: timeout=60
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
    "status": "UP"
}
```

Spring Boot Actuator can be integrated into [Spring Boot Admin](https://github.com/codecentric/spring-boot-admin) which provides a visual admin interface for your application. 
But this approach is not very popular and has some limitations. Therefore, we use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) instead of Spring Boot Actuator and [Grafana](https://grafana.com) instead of Spring Boot Admin to have a more popular and framework/language-independent solution. 

This solution approach needs vendor-neutral metrics and [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) is a popular tool for this use case.

## Micrometer

> Micrometer provides a simple facade over the instrumentation clients for the most popular monitoring systems, allowing you to instrument your JVM-based application code without vendor lock-in. 
> Think SLF4J, but for metrics.       

[Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) is an open-source project and provides a metric facade that exposes metric data in a vendor-neutral format that a monitoring system can understand. These monitoring systems are supported: 

- AppOptics
- Azure Monitor
- Netflix Atlas
- CloudWatch
- Datadog
- Dynatrace
- Elastic
- Ganglia 
- Graphite
- Humio
- Influx/Telegraf
- JMX
- KairosDB
- New Relic
- Prometheus
- SignalFx
- Google Stackdriver
- StatsD
- Wavefront

Micrometer is not part of the Spring ecosystem and needs to be added as a dependency. In our demo application, this was already done in the [Spring Initializr configuration](https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.3.4.RELEASE&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=de.mokkapps&artifactId=custom-metrics-demo&name=custom-metrics-demo&description=Custom%20metrics%20demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=de.mokkapps.custom-metrics-demo&dependencies=devtools,lombok,web,actuator,prometheus).

Next step is to expose the Prometheus metrics in `application.properties`: 

```
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus,health,info,metric
```

Now we can trigger this endpoint and see the Prometheus metrics:

### Custom Metrics

We can also define some custom metrics, which I will demonstrate in this section. The demo contains a `Scheduler` class which
periodically runs the included `schedulingTask` method. 

To be able to send custom metrics we need to import `MeterRegistry` from the Micrometer library and inject it into our class. For more detail please check the [official documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready-metrics-custom).

It is possible to instantiate these types of meters from `MeterRegistry`:

- [Counter](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/master/micrometer-core/src/main/java/io/micrometer/core/instrument/Counter.java#L25): reports merely a count over a specified property of an application
- [Gauge](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/master/micrometer-core/src/main/java/io/micrometer/core/instrument/Gauge.java#L23): shows the current value of a meter
- [Timers](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/master/micrometer-core/src/main/java/io/micrometer/core/instrument/Timer.java#L34): measures latencies or frequency of events
- [DistributionSummary](https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/blob/master/micrometer-core/src/main/java/io/micrometer/core/instrument/DistributionSummary.java#L29): provides distribution of events and a simple summary

I implemented a counter and a gauge for demonstration purposes:

```java
@Component
public class Scheduler {

  private final AtomicInteger testGauge;
  private final Counter testCounter;

  public Scheduler(MeterRegistry meterRegistry) {
    // Counter vs. gauge, summary vs. histogram
    // https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/#counter-vs-gauge-summary-vs-histogram
    testGauge = meterRegistry.gauge("custom_gauge", new AtomicInteger(0));
    testCounter = meterRegistry.counter("custom_counter");
  }

  @Scheduled(fixedRateString = "1000", initialDelayString = "0")
  public void schedulingTask() {
    testGauge.set(Scheduler.getRandomNumberInRange(0, 100));

    testCounter.increment();
  }

  private static int getRandomNumberInRange(int min, int max) {
    if (min >= max) {
      throw new IllegalArgumentException("max must be greater than min");
    }

    Random r = new Random();
    return r.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;
  }
}
```

If we run the application we can see that our custom metrics are exposed via the `actuatuor/prometheus` endpoint: 

```bash
▶ http GET "http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus" | grep custom
# HELP custom_gauge
# TYPE custom_gauge gauge
custom_gauge 29.0
# HELP custom_counter_total
# TYPE custom_counter_total counter
custom_counter_total 722.0
```

As we now have the metrics available in a format that Prometheus can understand, we will look at how to set up Prometheus.

## Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) stores our metric data in time series in memory by periodically pulling it via HTTP. The data can be visualized by a console template language, a built-in expression browser, or by integrating [Grafana](https://grafana.com) (which we will do after setting up Prometheus).

In this demo, we will run Prometheus locally in a Docker container and we, therefore, need some configurations in a `prometheus.yml` file that you can place anywhere on your hard drive: 

```yaml
global:
    scrape_interval: 10s # How frequently to scrape targets by default
  
scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'spring_micrometer'         # The job name is assigned to scraped metrics by default.
      metrics_path: '/actuator/prometheus'  # The HTTP resource path on which to fetch metrics from targets.
      scrape_interval: 5s                   # How frequently to scrape targets from this job.
      static_configs:                       # A static_config allows specifying a list of targets and a common label set for them
        - targets: ['192.168.178.22:8080']
```

All available configuration options can be seen in the [official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/).

As we want to run Prometheus in a Docker container we need to tell Prometheus our IP address instead of `localhost` in `static_configs -> targets`. Instead of `localhost:8080` we are using `192.168.178.22:8080` where `192.168.178.22` is my IP address at the moment. To get your system IP you can use `ifconfig` or `ipconfig` in your terminal depending on your operating system.

Now we are ready to run Prometheus:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v <path-to-your-prometheus.yml>:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```

`<path-to-your-prometheus.yml>` should be the path where you placed the `prometheus.yml` configuration file described above.

Finally, we can open the Prometheus on `http://localhost:9090` in the web browser and search for our custom metric named `custom_gauge`:

![Prometheus Graph](./images/prometheus-graph.png)

To check that Prometheus is correctly listening to our locally running Spring Boot application we can navigate to `Status -> Targets` in the top main navigation bar:

![Prometheus Targets](./images/prometheus-targets.png)

Prometheus provides a query language PromQL, check the [official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) for more details.

## Grafana

The included Prometheus browser graph is nice for basic visualization of our metrics but we will use [Grafana](https://grafana.com) instead. Grafana provides a rich UI where you create, explore and share dashboards that contain multiple graphs. 

Grafana can pull data from various data sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, etc. It also allows you to set rule-based alerts, which then can notify you over Slack, Email, Hipchat, and similar.

We start Grafana also locally in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

Opening `http://localhost:3000` in a browser should now show the following login page:

![Grafana Login](./images/grafana-login.png)

You can log in using the default username `admin` and the default password `admin`. After login, you should change these default passwords by visiting `http://localhost:3000/profile/password`.

The first step is to add our local Prometheus as our data source:

![Grafana Add Datasource](./images/grafana-add-datasource.png)
![Grafana Select Prometheus](./images/grafana-select-prometheus.png)
![Grafana Prometheus Config](./images/grafana-prometheus-config.png)


### Community Dashboard

The first dashboard we want to add is a [community dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards). As we are using a Spring Boot application we choose the popular [JVM dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/4701):

![Grafana Import JVM Dashboard](./images/grafana-import-dashboard.png)

After loading the URL we can see the imported dashboard:

![Grafana Imported JVM Dashboard](./images/grafana-jvm-dashboard.png)

### Custom Metric Dashboard

Finally, we want to create a new dashboard where we show our custom metrics. The first step is to create a new dashboard: 

![Grafana Imported JVM Dashboard](./images/grafana-new-dashboard.png)

Now we see a new dashboard where we can create a new panel:

![Grafana New Dashboard Panel](./images/grafana-dashboard-new-panel.png)

In the first panel we add a visualization for our `custom_gauge` metric. I use the `Stat` visualization as it shows the current value and a simple graph: 

![Grafana Stat Gauge Vizualization](./images/grafana-stat-gauge-metric.png)

Additionally, a new panel for the `custom_counter` metric is added to our dashboard: 

![Grafana Graph Counter Vizualization](./images/grafana-counter-metric.png)

In the end, the dashboard looks like this:

![Grafana Custom Dashboard](./images/grafana-final-dashboard.png)

## Conclusion
It is important to monitor an application's metrics and health which helps us to improve performance, manage the app in a better way and notice unoptimized behavior. 
Monitoring each service is important to be able to maintain a system that consists of many microservices.

In this article, I showed how a Spring Boot web application can be monitored using [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) which 
exposes metrics from our application, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) which stores the metric data and [Grafana](https://grafana.com) to visualize the data in graphs.

This popular monitoring approach should help you to maintain your applications and make your customers happy.
