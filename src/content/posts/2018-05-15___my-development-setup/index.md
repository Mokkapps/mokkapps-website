In the past, I stumbled upon many interesting tools by investigating the development setups of other developers. Therefore, I thought I could also present you my setup.

I change up things sometimes, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

## IDE + Editor + Terminal

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as text editor
* [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) as web development IDE
* [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) as terminal including [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with [avit theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/themes#avit) and [Roboto Mono for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) as font

## Desktop Apps

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) as my main browser

I am using a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018) for development and a custom-built desktop PC for gaming.

I use the Varmillo VA88M ISO-DE with clear MX switches:
